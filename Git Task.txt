	Q . What is git working tree...?
		The Working Tree is the area where you are currently working.
		It is where your files live. 
		This area is also known as the “untracked” area of git
		Any changes to files will be marked and seen in the Working Tree
		Here if you make changes and do not explicitly save them to git, 
		you will lose the changes made to your files.
		This loss of changes occurs because git is not aware of the files or changes in 
		the Working Tree until you tell it to pay attention to them.
